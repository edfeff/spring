# 6.1. Introduction
The previous chapter described the Spring’s support for AOP using @AspectJ and schema-based
aspect definitions. 
In this chapter we discuss the lower-level Spring AOP APIs and the AOP support
typically used in Spring 1.2 applications. For new applications, we recommend the use of the Spring
2.0 and later AOP support described in the previous chapter, but when working with existing
applications, or when reading books and articles, you may come across Spring 1.2 style examples.
Spring 5 remains backwards compatible with Spring 1.2 and everything described in this chapter is
fully supported in Spring 5.

大致就是说此章的内容是针对spring 1.2 的AOP的支持。不过Spring5对此也是支持的。
